## JavaScript Standards

We follow the AirBnB standard for all JavaScript programming. ESLint is installed in the package and is configured to enforce these standards. Please ensure that any tools you are using to automatically format your code are configured to use the AirBnB standard.

## Spell Checking

We use the  Code Spell Checker VS Code extension (streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) to check files for spelling mistakes. We use US English when spelling all words (for example, color vs. colour). Please ensure that words that are properly spelled but unrecognized are added to cspell.json in the root folder.
