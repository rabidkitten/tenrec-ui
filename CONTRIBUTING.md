## Spell Checking

We use the  Code Spell Checker VS Code extension (streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) to check files for spelling mistakes. We use US English when spelling all words (for example, color vs. colour). Please ensure that words that are properly spelled but unrecognized are added to cspell.json in the root folder.
